              How will the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0)<br />Impact the
              Future of Work?
            </h3>
            <p>
              IR 4.0 is upon us and has impacted societies, the workplace and
              future jobs and careers. The world is changing so rapidly, with
              more and more industries undergoing digital transformations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are witnessing the automation of manufacturing plants, machine
              learning and artificial intelligence in operations, and the rise
              of smart cities. Future jobs will require skilled employees who
              are able to digitally network with teams and possess knowledge in
              cloud-based application systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              To meet the demands of IR 4.0, MCKL recognises the need to equip
              our students with future-oriented skills. Our new diploma
              programmes are here to prepare our students to be job-ready.
