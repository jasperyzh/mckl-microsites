                The Game of Life is a short course that you can complete in
                just under 2 hours to be equipped with the skills to
                understand yourself and the world better to discern and make
                the wiser decisions in life.

                You will learn how does our decisions in games give insights
                to the decisions we make in real life. We will explore the
                Golden Circle by Simon Sinek on communicating from the Why
                (Values, cause, Belief).
              </li>
              <li class="terms-condition__list-point">
                We will also explore the theory of Finite and Infinite Games
                by James P. Carse on understanding the parameters of the
                world you live in to know what to do and what not to do.
              </li>
              <li class="terms-condition__list-point">
                In learning these concepts, you will be able to have a
                better idea on who you are, what career you might want to
                grow in, and how to live out the way you were designed to
                be. It will also be a practical session and not just
                concepts where they are required to play an online game, set
                goals, and identify their values in life.
