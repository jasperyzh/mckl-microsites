              Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) is upon us and has impacted
              societies, business models, future jobs and careers. As more
              emphasis is placed on smart solutions, automation, data analytics
              and internet of things (IoT) technology in businesses, the demand
              for digitally-skilled talents are also widely growing.
            </p>
            <p>
              To meet the demands of IR 4.0, MCKL recognises the need to equip
              our students with future-oriented skills. Our new diploma
              programmes are here to prepare our students to be job-ready!

            Have you ever wondered how to start your own online business or how
            international brands have embraced Digital Business as part of their
            retail strategy? Digital Business is a sales channel that enables
            entrepreneurs and businesses to sell online, directly to consumers,
            but thatâ€™s not all. It is also about marketing, gaining consumer
            trust and confidence and so much more; without physically
            interacting with customers both locally and beyond geographical
            borders.

          <h4 class="my-4">What is Financial Technology (FinTech)?</h4>
          <p>
            Imagine 10 years ago, would you have ever guessed that we are en
            route to becoming a cashless society or that financial instruments
            no longer require banks or face to face interactions to take place?
            This is FinTech. FinTech, or financial technology, is used to
            describe businesses that use technological innovation to enhance or
            automate their financial services and products. This allows for
            quicker processes, personalised services, and more accurate data.
            Technology in finance continues to evolve due to advances in big
            data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and data
            science. FinTech is now being used in various areas of finance such
            as mobile banking, cryptocurrency, blockchain, investment and
            trading.
